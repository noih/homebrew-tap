# Filled in by .github/workflows/release.yml and attached to each release as

# Formula/difv.rb — see the Install section of the README.

# Shaped to pass both of the tap's checks. `brew readall --os=all --arch=all`
# loads the formula on every platform, so every platform must see a URL: the
# macOS build is the top-level default and Linux overrides it. `brew audit
# --strict` wants no `version` (read from the URL) and `depends_on` before the
# platform blocks.
